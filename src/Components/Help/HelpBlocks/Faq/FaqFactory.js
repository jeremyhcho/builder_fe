    question: 'What tools does Quartz offer?',
    answer: 'Quartz allows you to create simplified models by applying "weights" onto specific key metrics when determining the type of prediction your model makes. These models automatically generate and update predictions throughout the day and if left active, it takes the prediction into its win/loss. You can toggle a model\'s active state per game (through the game details page) or entirely in the Models section.'
